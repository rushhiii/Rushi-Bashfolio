# Chapter 6: Theme Management

Welcome back to the `Rushi-Bashfolio` tutorial! In the last chapter, [Output Rendering Engine](05_output_rendering_engine_.md), we saw how the website takes the text content for command responses and displays it on the screen, line by line, with cool typing effects.

But what about the *look* of that text? The background color? The color of the prompt? The font style? That's all controlled by the **Theme Management** system.

## What is Theme Management?

Think about changing the wallpaper or the color scheme on your computer or phone. Theme Management in `Rushi-Bashfolio` is just like that! It's the system that lets you **change the entire visual style** of the web terminal with a single click.

Its main jobs are:

1.  **Defining Different Styles:** Having separate sets of rules (called themes) for how everything should look (colors, fonts, spacing).
2.  **Applying a Chosen Style:** Loading and activating the CSS rules for the theme you select.
3.  **Providing a Way to Switch:** Offering a user interface element (like the floating boxes you see) that lets you easily pick a theme.
4.  **Remembering Your Choice:** Saving your preferred theme so it loads automatically next time you visit.

It's like having a "Display Settings" menu specifically for the terminal's appearance.

## The Core Task: Changing the Look and Feel

The main goal of Theme Management is simple: allow the user to instantly change the appearance of the terminal.

Here's the central use case:
1.  The user sees the terminal with the current theme applied.
2.  They interact with a visual element (the theme switcher).
3.  They select a different theme.
4.  The website instantly changes colors, fonts, and other styles to match the new theme.
5.  The website remembers this choice for their next visit.

## Defining Themes: Separate CSS Files

In web development, the visual style of a page is controlled by **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets). A theme is essentially just a collection of CSS rules that define the look of different elements.

In `Rushi-Bashfolio`, each theme has its own dedicated CSS file in the `css/` folder. You can see files like `aurora.css`, `espresso.css`, `green.css`, `pink.css`, `b&w.css`, `academia.css`, and `default.css`.

Let's look at how just the `body` element (the main background and text color container from [Terminal Core UI](01_terminal_core_ui_.md)) is styled differently in two themes:

**From `css/aurora.css`:**

```css
/* From css/aurora.css */
body {
    /* ... other properties ... */
    color: #d0e7f9; /* Light bluish text */
    background: linear-gradient(180deg, #0b0c10 0%, #232946 100%); /* Dark gradient background */
    /* ... other properties ... */
}
```

**From `css/espresso.css`:**

```css
/* From css/espresso.css */
* {
    /* ... different font size ... */
    font-size: 13px;
    /* ... other properties ... */
}

body {
    /* ... other properties ... */
    color: #f8f8f2; /* Cream white text */
    background: #1e1e1e; /* Espresso black solid background */
    /* ... different box shadow ... */
    box-shadow: inset 0 0 20px 0 #000000cc;
    /* ... other properties ... */
}
```

You can see how just by changing the `color`, `background`, and maybe `font-size` properties for the `body`, the basic look changes completely between themes. Each theme file contains different styles for the prompt (`#liner`), the cursor (`.cursor`), command output lines (`p`, `.command`, `.error`), links (`a`), and so on.

## Applying Themes: The CSS Link Tag

The web browser knows which CSS file to use based on the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of the `index.html` file.

Look at the `<head>` in `index.html`:

```html
<!-- From index.html <head> (simplified) -->
<head>
    <!-- ... meta tags, title ... -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/aurora.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/set_theme.css">
    <!-- ... other theme links might be commented out ... -->
    <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/espresso.css"> -->
    <!-- ... -->
</head>
```

The line `<link rel="stylesheet" ... href="css/aurora.css">` tells the browser to load and apply the styles from the `aurora.css` file. The other theme links are commented out, meaning they are ignored by the browser.

To switch themes, the website needs to **change the `href` attribute** of this `<link>` tag to point to a *different* CSS file (e.g., change `"css/aurora.css"` to `"css/espresso.css"`).

## The Theme Switcher UI: HTML and CSS

How do you select a theme? The project has a floating panel with colored boxes. This panel is defined in the HTML structure near the end of the `index.html` body:

```html
<!-- From index.html (simplified) -->
<body>
    <!-- ... terminal content ... -->

    <!-- Theme Switcher -->
    <div id="theme-switcher">
        <div class="theme-box" data-theme="aurora.css" style="background:#232946" title="Aurora"><span>Aurora</span></div>
        <div class="theme-box" data-theme="espresso.css" style="background:#1e1e1e" title="Espresso"><span>Espresso</span></div>
        <!-- ... other theme-box divs ... -->
    </div>

    <!-- ... scripts ... -->
</body>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `<div id="theme-switcher">`: This is the main container for the theme switcher.
2.  `<div class="theme-box" ...>`: Each of these divs represents a single theme option.
    *   `data-theme="aurora.css"`: This custom `data-` attribute is important! It stores the *filename* of the CSS file for this theme. JavaScript will read this when the box is clicked.
    *   `style="background:#232946"`: This sets a background color for the box itself, visually representing the theme.
    *   `title="Aurora"`: Provides a tooltip when you hover.
    *   `<span>Aurora</span>`: Contains the theme name, which appears when you hover over the box.

The `css/set_theme.css` file contains all the styling for `#theme-switcher` and `.theme-box` to make them float in the corner, have rounded corners, show the name on hover, and hide/show based on whether the main container is hovered.

## Making it Interactive: JavaScript

The magic that connects the clicking of a `.theme-box` to changing the `<link>` tag's `href` happens in the `<script>` block right before the closing `</body>` tag in `index.html`.

Here's the core JavaScript logic for theme switching:

```javascript
// From index.html (script block - simplified)

// 1. Get references to the elements we need
const themeBoxes = document.querySelectorAll('#theme-switcher .theme-box'); // All theme boxes
const themeLink = document.querySelector('link[rel=stylesheet][href^="css/"]'); // The main theme CSS link

// Helper function to mark the currently active theme box
function setActiveThemeBox(theme) {
  themeBoxes.forEach(box => {
    if (box.getAttribute('data-theme') === theme) {
      box.classList.add('active'); // Add 'active' class to the matching box
    } else {
      box.classList.remove('active'); // Remove 'active' from others
    }
  });
}

// 2. Add a click listener to each theme box
themeBoxes.forEach(box => {
  box.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const theme = box.getAttribute('data-theme'); // Get the theme filename from data-theme

    if (themeLink) { // Check if the link tag was found
      themeLink.setAttribute('href', 'css/' + theme); // *** CHANGE THE CSS FILE! ***
      localStorage.setItem('selectedTheme', theme); // *** REMEMBER THE CHOICE! ***
      setActiveThemeBox(theme); // Update which box looks active
    }
  });
});

// 3. On page load, check if a theme was saved
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('selectedTheme');
if (savedTheme && themeLink) {
  themeLink.setAttribute('href', 'css/' + savedTheme); // Load saved theme
  setActiveThemeBox(savedTheme); // Mark it active
} else {
  // If no saved theme, figure out which one is initially loaded and mark it active
  const currentTheme = themeLink.getAttribute('href').replace('css/', '');
  setActiveThemeBox(currentTheme);
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Getting Elements:** It finds all the theme box divs and, importantly, the `<link>` tag that's currently loading a CSS file from the `css/` folder.
2.  **`setActiveThemeBox`:** This small function is just for updating the *appearance* of the theme switcher itself, adding an `active` class to the box corresponding to the currently loaded theme so you can see which one is selected.
3.  **Click Listener:** It loops through each `.theme-box` and adds an event listener. When a box is clicked:
    *   It reads the `data-theme` attribute to get the name of the CSS file (e.g., `"espresso.css"`).
    *   `themeLink.setAttribute('href', 'css/' + theme);`: This is the core theme-switching action! It changes the `href` of the `<link>` tag. The browser immediately notices this change and **loads the new CSS file and applies its styles**, changing the entire look of the page.
    *   `localStorage.setItem('selectedTheme', theme);`: This saves the chosen theme's filename (e.g., `"espresso.css"`) into the browser's `localStorage`. This is a simple way for a website to store small pieces of information persistently in your browser, so it's still there even if you close and reopen the tab or browser.
    *   `setActiveThemeBox(theme);`: Updates the visual state of the theme boxes.
4.  **Loading Saved Theme:** When the page first loads, the script checks `localStorage` for a value stored under the key `'selectedTheme'`. If it finds one, it means you chose a theme previously. It then updates the `<link>` tag's `href` to load that saved theme and marks the corresponding box as active. If no theme is saved, it just identifies the theme already loaded by the initial `<link>` tag (like `aurora.css` in the example HTML) and marks that box active.

## How it Works: Switching Theme Flow

Here's a simplified sequence diagram showing what happens when you click a theme box:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant Theme Box (Clicked)
    participant JS Script
    participant CSS Link Element (<link>)
    participant New CSS File

    User->Theme Box (Clicked): Click theme box
    Theme Box (Clicked)->JS Script: Trigger click event
    JS Script->Theme Box (Clicked): Read data-theme attribute (e.g., "espresso.css")
    JS Script->CSS Link Element (<link>): Update href attribute to "css/espresso.css"
    JS Script->JS Script: Save "espresso.css" to localStorage
    JS Script->Theme Box (Clicked): Call setActiveThemeBox("espresso.css")<br/>(Adds 'active' class)
    Browser->CSS Link Element (<link>): Detect href change
    Browser->New CSS File: Request css/espresso.css
    New CSS File-->Browser: Receive CSS rules
    Browser->Browser: Apply new CSS rules to the page
    Note over Browser: Page appearance changes instantly (colors, fonts, etc.)
```

This flow illustrates how a simple click triggers a JavaScript function that modifies the HTML `<link>` element, prompting the browser to load and apply a new set of styles, thereby changing the theme.

## Key Components of Theme Management

Here's a summary of the pieces involved in managing themes:

| Component                    | Role in Theme Management                                     | Location              |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Separate CSS Files (`.css`)  | Define the visual rules for each distinct theme.             | `css/` folder         |
| `<link rel="stylesheet">`    | Links the HTML page to the currently active theme CSS file.  | `index.html` `<head>` |
| `<div id="theme-switcher">`  | Container for the theme selection UI panel.                  | `index.html` `<body>` |
| `<div class="theme-box">`    | Represents a single theme option in the UI.                  | `index.html` `<body>` |
| `data-theme` attribute       | Stores the filename of the CSS file for a specific theme box. | `index.html` `.theme-box` |
| `css/set_theme.css`          | Styles the floating theme switcher UI panel and boxes.       | `css/` folder         |
| JavaScript in `<script>`     | Handles click events, changes the `<link>` `href`, manages `localStorage`. | `index.html` `<body>` |
| `localStorage`               | Remembers the user's selected theme between visits.          | Browser Feature       |
| `setActiveThemeBox` function | Updates which theme box in the UI appears selected.          | `index.html` `<script>` |

These components work together to give the user control over the terminal's appearance and make their preference persistent.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we've explored **Theme Management**, the system that allows you to customize the look and feel of your `Rushi-Bashfolio` web terminal. We learned that themes are defined in separate CSS files, and the active theme is applied by linking to the correct CSS file in the HTML `<head>`. We saw how the floating theme switcher UI is built with HTML and styled with CSS, and most importantly, how a JavaScript script handles clicks on the theme boxes, changes the CSS link's `href` to switch themes, and uses `localStorage` to remember your preferred theme for future visits.

You now understand how all the major visible and interactive parts of the `Rushi-Bashfolio` project work together – from the basic UI and handling your typing, to interpreting commands, finding the right data, displaying output, and finally, changing the entire visual style with themes!
